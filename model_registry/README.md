## Model Registry

Once we've logged one or more models into our model registry, we can click the models tab on the left in Databricks in order to get an overview of our model registry with all the models and their current stages.

This gives us a lot of transparency in terms of what is currently being deployed, which versions were previously deployed, with links to all the model objects, allowing us to inspect what code and data they were trained on, etc.
