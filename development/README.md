## Development

There are multiples tools out there that address ML experiment management and collaboration for data scientists, some examples being Neptune.ai, Weights&Biases, Comet.ml and mlflow.

- A solid foundation for data engineering workflows. This data, which could be highly confidential and potentially could be something we are not allowed to keep on local computers, is needed for training our models.

- A scalable and collaborative platform for running data science experiments within notebooks on actual data, very similar to jupyter notebooks.

- Versioning of both the data and the code being used to train a given ML model, as well as information relating to model training (through tools Delta Lake, Jobs API, and mlflow).
